# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math from library to use sqrt function
### Step 2: 
Assign four values to their corresponding variables
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Round off the distance value and print the same
### Step 5: 
End of the program
### PROGRAM:
~~~
#Program to find the distance between two points.
#Developed by: CHARU NETHRA R
#RegisterNumber: 23013558
import math
x1,y1 = 4,2
x2,y2 = 10,6
distance = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print(round(distance,2))  
~~~
### OUTPUT:

### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points are successfully executed
